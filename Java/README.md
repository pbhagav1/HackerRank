## [TwoRobots] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Java/TwoRobots)
You have a warehouse with **M** containers filled with an infinite number of candies. 
The containers are arranged in a single row, equally spaced to be **1** meter apart. 
You also have **2** robots that can pick up **1** piece of candy and transport it between any two containers.
The robots take instructions in the form of queries consisting of two integers, **a** and **b**,respectively. 
To execute a query, a robot travels to container **a**, picks up **1** candy, transports it to container **b**, 
and then stops at **b** until it receives another query.

Calculate the minimum total distance the robots must travel to execute **N** queries in order.
