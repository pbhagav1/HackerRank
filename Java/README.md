## [TwoRobots] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Java/TwoRobots) 	**_Algorithms_** 
You have a warehouse with **M** containers filled with an infinite number of candies. 
The containers are arranged in a single row, equally spaced to be **1** meter apart. 
You also have **2** robots that can pick up **1** piece of candy and transport it between any two containers.
The robots take instructions in the form of queries consisting of two integers, **a** and **b**,respectively. 
To execute a query, a robot travels to container **a**, picks up **1** candy, transports it to container **b**, 
and then stops at **b** until it receives another query.

Calculate the minimum total distance the robots must travel to execute **N** queries in order.

## [FunnyString] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Java/FunnyString)		**_Algorithms_** 
Suppose you have a String **S** of length **N** that is indexed from **0** to **N-1**. You also have some String, **R**,
that is the reverse of String **S**. **R** is funny if the condition is true for **|S[i] - S[i-1]| = |R[i] - R[i-1]|**
every character **i** from **1** to **N-1**.
