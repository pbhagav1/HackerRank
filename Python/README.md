## [BuildAPalindrome] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/BuildAPalindrome)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Strings_**; **_Hard_**

You have two strings, **_A_** and **_B_**. Find a string, **_S_**, such that:

  - **_S_** can be expressed as **_Sa_** + **_Sb_** where **_Sa_** is a non-empty substring of **_A_** and **_Sb_** is a non-empty substring of **_B_** .
  - **_S_** is a palindromic string.
  - The length of is **_S_** as long as possible.

## [CamelCase] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/CamelCase)
**_Algorithms_**; **_String_**; **_Hard_**

Alice wrote a sequence of words in CamelCase as a string of letters, **_s_**, having the following properties:
  -  It is a concatenation of one or more words consisting of English letters.
  -  All letters in the first word are _lowercase_.
  -  For each of the subsequent words, the first letter is _uppercase_ and rest of the letters are _lowercase_.

Given **_s_**, print the number of words in on a new line.

## [JumpingOnTheClouds] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/JumpingOnTheClouds)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Implementation_**; **_Hard_**

Emma is playing a new mobile game involving **_n_** clouds numbered from **_0_** to **_n-1_**. A player initially starts
out on cloud **_c0_**, and they must jump to cloud **_cn-1_**. In each step, she can jump from any cloud **_i_** to cloud
**_i+1_** or cloud **_i+2_**.

There are two types of clouds, _ordinary clouds_ and _thunderclouds_. The game ends if Emma jumps onto a
thundercloud, but if she reaches the last cloud (i.e., **_cn-1_**), she wins the game!

Can you find the minimum number of jumps Emma must make to win the game? It is guaranteed that
clouds **_c0_** and **_cn-1_** are ordinary-clouds and it is always possible to win the game.

## [MinimumDistances] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/MinimumDistances)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Implementation_**; **_Hard_**

Consider an array of **_n_** integers, **_A = [a0, a1, ..., an-1]_**. 
The distance between two indices, **_i_** and **_j_**, is denoted by **_di,j = |i - j|_**.

Given **_A_**, find the minimum **_di,j_** such that **_ai_** = **_aj_** and **_i_** != **_j_**. 
In other words, find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. 
If no such value exists, print **_-1_**.

## [SherlockAndArray] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/SherlockAndArray)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Search_**; **_Easy_**

Watson gives Sherlock an array **_A_** of length **_N_**. 
Then he asks him to determine if there exists an element in the array such that 
the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. 
If there are no elements to the left/right, then the sum is considered to be zero. 


## [TheMinionGame] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/TheMinionGame)
**_Strings_**; **_Medium_**

Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.
  - Both players are given the same string **_S_**.
  - Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string **_S_**.
  - Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
  - Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
  - The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
