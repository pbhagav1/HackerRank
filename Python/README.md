## [BuildAPalindrome] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/BuildAPalindrome)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Strings_**; **_Hard_**

You have two strings, **_A_** and **_B_**. Find a string, **_S_**, such that:

  - **_S_** can be expressed as **_Sa_** + **_Sb_** where **_Sa_** is a non-empty substring of **_A_** and **_Sb_** is a non-empty substring of **_B_** .
  - **_S_** is a palindromic string.
  - The length of is **_S_** as long as possible.

## [SherlockAndArray] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/SherlockAndArray)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Search_**; **_Easy_**

Watson gives Sherlock an array **_A_** of length **_N_**. 
Then he asks him to determine if there exists an element in the array such that 
the sum of the elements on its left is equal to the sum of the elements on its right. 
If there are no elements to the left/right, then the sum is considered to be zero. 


## [TheMinionGame] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/TheMinionGame)
**_Strings_**; **_Medium_**

Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.
  - Both players are given the same string **_S_**.
  - Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string **_S_**.
  - Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
  - Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
  - The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
