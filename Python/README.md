## [BuildAPalindrome] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/BuildAPalindrome)
**_Algorithms_**; **_Strings_**; **_Hard_**

You have two strings, **_A_** and **_B_**. Find a string, **_S_**, such that:

  - **_S_** can be expressed as **_Sa_** + **_Sb_** where **_Sa_** is a non-empty substring of **_A_** and **_Sb_** is a non-empty substring of **_B_** .
  - **_S_** is a palindromic string.
  - The length of is **_S_** as long as possible.

## [TheMinionGame] (https://github.com/pbhagav1/HackerRank/tree/master/Python/TheMinionGame)
**_Strings_**; **_Medium_**

Kevin and Stuart want to play the 'The Minion Game'.
  - Both players are given the same string **_S_**.
  - Both players have to make substrings using the letters of the string **_S_**.
  - Stuart has to make words starting with consonants.
  - Kevin has to make words starting with vowels.
  - The game ends when both players have made all possible substrings.
