**_Algorithms_**; **_Strings_**; **_Hard_**

You have two strings, **_A_** and **_B_**. Find a string, **_S_**, such that:

  - **_S_** can be expressed as **_Sa_** + **_Sb_** where **_Sa_** is a non-empty substring of **_A_** and **_Sb_** is a non-empty substring of **_B_** .
  - **_S_** is a palindromic string.
  - The length of is **_S_** as long as possible.
